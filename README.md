# .dotfiles

Personal dotfiles

Heavily modeled after ThePrimeagen's .dotfiles repo [here](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles)
Some of it is shamelessly taken from him since this is my first time doing this

Since I use a mac for my job and windows for personal, this repo has some configs for both environments


Some other inspirations:
Natelandau for zsh [profile](https://natelandau.com/my-mac-os-zsh-profile/)
